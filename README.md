to withdraw money,deposit.
## Steps:
1.Download Star UML.

2.Select Add model and select the model which you are going to draw.

3.Draw the diagram.

4.Save the diagram successfully.

5.Execute it.

## USECASE DIAGRAM: 

A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify and organize system requirements. The use case is made up of a set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and related to a particular goal.

## ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:

Activity Diagrams are used to illustrate the flow of control in a system and refer to the steps involved in the execution of a use case. It is a type of behavioral diagram and we can depict both sequential processing and concurrent processing of activities using an activity diagram ie an activity diagram focuses on the condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens.

## SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:

Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a modeling language in the field of software engineering that aims to set standard ways to visualize the design of a system. UML guides the creation of multiple types of diagrams such as interaction, structure, and behavior diagrams. A sequence diagram is the most commonly used interaction diagram.

## COMMUNICATION DIAGRAM:

Communication diagrams, formerly known as collaboration diagrams, are almost identical to sequence diagrams in UML, but they focus more on the relationships of objects—how they associate and connect through messages in a sequence rather than interactions. With our UML diagramming tool, refer to this guide on everything you need to know when planning and creating a communication diagram in UML.

## STATECHART DIAGRAM:

A State Machine Diagram is used to represent the condition of the system or part of the system at finite instances of time. It’s a behavioral diagram and it represents the behavior using finite state transitions

## PACKAGE DIAGRAM:
A package is used as a container to organize the elements present in the system into a more manageable unit. It is very useful to represent the system’s architecture and design as a cohesive unit and a concise manner.

### RESULT: 
Thus the Atm and banking System project was executed and the output was verified.
